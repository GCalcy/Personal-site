    <h1>VEIL OF INNOCENCE</h1>
    <h4 color="silver">BY SENTIBILIN</h4>
    <p>
      The veil of innocence that hid the wicked face,
      <br>
      Came down as the sunset at the dusk,
      <br>
      Great words and deeds or rather abased,
      <br>
      Are now just broken bits as that of a rusk.
