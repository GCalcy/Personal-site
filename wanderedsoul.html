    <h1>A WANDERED SOUL</h1>
    <h4 color="silver">BY SENTIBILIN</h4>
    <p>
      A wandered soul in its own parade,
      <br>
      Soaring along the moonlight shade,
      <br>
      Gliding slow, through through the darksome lonely night;
      <br>
      A darkness ever so unveil'd,
      <br>
      And silence in its might prevail'd,
      <br>
      Awakening the fear that'll fore'er abide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly lay in dark estate,
      <br>
      As despair's what that's bound its fate,
      <br>
      With moans and sobs of grief in silent hours;
      <br>
      Spirit's low, the fear to quell,
      <br>
      And grievant heart that's bound to dwell,
      <br>
      For life's held captive behind the gravely bars.
