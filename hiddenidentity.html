    <h1>THE HIDDEN IDENTITY</h1>
    <h4 color="silver">BY SENTIBILIN</h4>
    <p>
      Puts her makeup on while she plasters a smile,
      <br>
      On the red carpet she walks with her high heels on;
      <br>
      Her red dress conceals just for a while,
      <br>
      But her heart knows, when she gets home, it'll all be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one can see her hidden identity,
      <br>
      The secret life she lives when all the curtains fall;
      <br>
      Her husband to be blamed for her misery,
      <br>
      For all the tortur she receives behind the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fake identity defines her to the world,
      <br>
      But little do they know about the life she hides;
      <br>
      Insurmountable pain in her heart they crawl,
      <br>
      Her journal's the only friend her pain she confides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Identity holds no meaning in her life,
      <br>
      When her real identity lies behind closed doors;
      <br>
      No matter all the hardships she has to strife,
      <br>
      Her own little world keeps crashing down the floor.
