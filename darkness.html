    <h1>DARKNESS</h1>
    <h4 color="silver">BY SENTIBILIN</h4>
    <p>
      The darkness is, but the end of night,
      <br>
      The wind will blow, yet soon it'll slide
      <br>
      While darling you can chase the dawn,
      <br>
      Don't whine in pain, just stitch the torn,
      <br>
      The end of the tunnel you soon will reach,
      <br>
      The darkness in itself will breach
      <br>
      Don't let it conquer your soul my dear,
      <br>
      The hurdles are, but none to fear.
